# Kaito Repository
Kaito Repository contains all the Website Development project I have and will build. This repository is named after my Family name as this repo will serve as my Mainpage as well

## Main Goals
- Build and Deploy Personal Portfolio
- Make CSS Guide and Visualizer under this Repository
- Real Time data viewing (Future Update)

### To achieve these Main Goals, I will be using these tools:
- Django Framework (Python)
- PostgreSQL

*Note: I will be adding Table of Content after one of the Main Goals has been established and deployed! Stay tune*
